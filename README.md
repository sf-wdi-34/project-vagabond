## Brief

We have been commissioned to build a travel community, code-named **Project Vagabond** for now, for users to share tips (AKA posts) about their favorite locations around the world.

## Client Contract

The client has provided basic wireframes and user stories. In some cases, these requirements may be vague or incomplete.

* [Wireframes](./wireframes.png)
* [User Stories](./user-stories.md)

## Process

The client contract consists of three core sprints and four bonus sprints. Each sprint contains a set of user stories. You may not complete all of the sprints within the time period, and that's ok. **The goal is to gain experience working on a development project in a group while navigating a client's feature list.**

**IMPORTANT:** You may not begin a new sprint or start on a bonus without client approval.

You will work in groups of 3-4, and we expect you to **pair program** for the majority of the time you're writing code.

During morning scrums and in smaller check-ins throughout the day, clearly communicate your current status and next steps to your teammates. Use a kanban-style scrum board such as **Trello** or **GitHub projects** to organize tasks ([example Trello board](https://trello.com/b/JPdt327u/vagabond) , [example GitHub projects board](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/project-vagabond/projects/2)).

Commit changes at least once for each user story. Consider creating **automated tests** or even implementing TDD for any complex application behavior.

Put effort into your **design**. Use a CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap), partials, and some custom CSS or Sass/Less.

Work as **[git collaborators](./git-collaboration-workflow.md), build on feature branches, and submit pull requests for approval and merging**.

After each sprint, **deploy to heroku** to get practice getting the app online. The earlier you resolve deployment, the easier it will be on each updated version.

**Refactor** your code after each sprint, considering:

* Indentation
* Readability/clarity
* Naming
* Organization
* Commenting
* DRYness

## Questions to Ask Yourselves

1. **Are you all clear about what the client wants?** Identify vague areas. Seek clarification in any cases where you feel less confident about your interpretation of the client's vision.

2. **What will the UX/UI flow be?** Hammer out any areas of ambiguity in the wireframes

3. **Which models do you need to implement?** Create an ERD for the client to reference.

4. **What are the major milestones or components that you need to complete?** How can these be turned into tasks that group members can complete in pairs? Where do these milestones overlap and how will those related tasks be managed?

5. **What milestones are you and your group members interested in working on?** How can you effectively delegate the work into pairs so that each group member is interested, challenged, and productive?

## Groups

Each group has an assigned instructor who will act as your client as well as give technical support during instructor-group meetings.

#### Team \#1 - Brianna
* Alex
* Amber
* LD
* Mike

#### Team \#2 - Cory
* Aaron
* Greice
* Ryan
* Shiv

#### Team \#3 - Brianna
* Ricardo
* RJ
* Zach

## Presentation

Each group will present their project on **Monday, February 6th** starting at **1:15pm**.

Presentations will be 12-15 minutes long and each member of your group should speak for equal time during your presentation. Each group member should mention which parts of the project they worked on.

**Your presentation should include:**

* Tour (demo) of your app deployed on heroku.
* How did your group approach the requirements? (mention anything unique or creative your group chose to do)
* What was easier than you thought? What was more challenging?
* What is a lesson you will carry forward to working on Project 2?
* Shout outs for fellow students!

## Evaluation

Share your project's links in [this project turn-in google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vzxkkVwX2zU40BZArMknoHMYlu_5bVmyNYAEBMJXH5E/edit?usp=sharing). 

You will complete [self-reflection and peer feedback](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/project-vagabond/blob/master/peer-feedback.md).  

In addition, your project will be evaluated on the following measures:

1. Project workflow
  - frequent commits with good commit messages
  - cooperative group work including majority of pair programing
  - effective use of branches
  - planning to avoid excessive merge conflicts
  - deliberate approach - routeside-in, logical progress from skateboard to car
  - the code is your original code
1. Execution
  - to what degree does your app fulfill the user stories?
  - code is clean
  - follows good naming conventions
  - code is free of obvious errors and bugs
  - code demonstrates good problem solving
  - code is DRY
1. Technical requirements
  - users are authenticated
  - full CRUD for cities
  - custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using the asset pipeline)
  - users are authorized
  - deployed to heroku
  - commenting (optional)
1. Creativity
  - polished appearance
  - personalized spin, not just a template
