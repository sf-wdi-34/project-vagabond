# Project Vagabond: Peer Feedback

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

- Giving and receiving feedback is a lifelong skill that helps us become better developers and better people. 


### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- Self-evaluate strengths and areas for improvement while maintaining a growth mindset.
- Provide specific, actionable, honest constructive feedback to teammates. 

### Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- Describe what qualities make feedback more or less helpful. 
- Interact with colleagues respectfully.
- Define growth mindset. 


### Independent Practice: Written Feedback

Take 15 minutes to fill out the [vagabond self reflection & peer feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/d3YDETNJHgLqttXT2).  The form will ask you to:
  - write about a technical and an interpersonal strength of each person on your team - behaviors or traits you think the person should continue to emphasize
  - write down an area where the person could improve
  

### Group Practice: Verbal Feedback

One person on your team should volunteer to receive feedback first. Let's call this person "Matt".

1. While everyone else listens carefully, Matt should say one thing he thinks he did well during the project and one thing he'd like to improve for future projects.  This should take about 2 minutes. 

1. The person to Matt's right should add feedback for about 2 minutes. To do this:
  - briefly describe one thing Matt did well (it can be the same as what Matt noticed)
  - breifly describe one area where you think Matt could improve for future projects (again, it could be the same as what Matt noticed)
  - offer any strategy or advice you thought of that Matt could use to improve

1. Everyone else should add feedback for about 4 more minutes. This could be an open discussion of what the first two people said, or it could follow the format from the last step. 


### Closing Thoughts

1. Thank your group for providing feedback.
1. Think about the parts of the feedback that will be most useful to you. 
1. Write down one thing you'd like to improve on for your next group project and one specific strategy you could use.
